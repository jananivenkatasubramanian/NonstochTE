# Towards targeted exploration for non-stochastic disturbances
This repository contains code for the work "Towards targeted exploration for non-stochastic disturbances". The details of this work can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896324013685#fn1) or [here](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.05947v1)

# Simulations

1. Install [CVX](https://cvxr.com/cvx/) for MATLAB
2. The [main script](main_nonstoch.m) contains links to and instructions for all the dependent scripts.
3. Run the [main script](main_nonstoch.m) under the desired conditions (per section, if required).
4. Collect data and use a scipt similar to the [plotting script](plot_onlystoch.m) to visualize the results.
