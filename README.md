# Robust targeted exploration for systems with non-stochastic disturbances
This repository contains code for the work "Robust targeted exploration for systems with non-stochastic disturbances". The details of this work can be found [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20426](link).

# Simulations

1. Install [CVX](https://cvxr.com/cvx/) for MATLAB
2. The [main script](main_nonstoch_guarantees.m) contains links to and instructions for all the dependent scripts.
3. Run the [main script](main_nonstoch_guarantees.m) under the desired conditions (per section, if required).
4. Collect data and use a scipt similar to the [plotting script](nonstoch_plots.m) to visualize the results.
